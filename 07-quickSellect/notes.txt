QuickSellect:

1. Choose a partition element randomly-ish (called pivot point)
2. Rearange the array such that all elements < the pivot point are on the left of all elements < than the pivot. Those numebrs = to pivot don't matter.
   	    Maybe delete them for optomization?
3. 

we will need a few fxns:

int quicksellect(int[]L, int k) 
    //optionally send a copy of L to next level, if you want.

int quicksellect(int[]L, int k, int left, int right) //

int partition (int[]L, int left, int right){
    // Sellect a pivot point
    // Partition
    // @Return the index of the pivot
       //NOTE: We do not want to creat new arrays, so that our runtime remains O(n)
    }
