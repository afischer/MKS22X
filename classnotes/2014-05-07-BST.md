###DN: Insert each set of numbers into a BST (Draw the tree)

1. {50,25,75,12,36,63,83}
2. {21,24,36,50,63,75,84}

```

        50 	        12 
       /   \		 \
      25   75		  36	
     / \   / \		   \ 
    12 36 63 84		    25
			     \
			      50
			       \
			        63
				 \
				  75
				   \
				    84
```

###Runtime of Trees
- Recusrively, we could create a balanced tree (by taking from each side) of a balanced list
- What about other processes?

|: Process     	  	       	       :|:    Runtime    :|
| Sorted list --> balanced tree		| O(n)		  |
| Unsorted list --> balanced tree	| O(nlogn)	  |
| Print all elements in order		| O(n)		  |
| find(x)   	     			| O(logn) <-> O(n) worst case	  |
| insert(x)				| O(logn)	  |
| remove(x)`				| O(logn)	  |

##### Printing in order:

We will have an algorithm that will go through our tree, running on the left side, i.e., f(left), then f(f(left)), until all are printed, then do the smae on the right.
