# Stacks
*And their applications*  
  
### Using MyStack
- If we are getting a warning, that's okay **YOU MUST know what that warning is!** Be careful with the generic arrays
- Never send a reference to that array outside of your program. 

  
### HP 12/15 c Calculators
HP Calculators use post-fixe notation. i.e., punching in 2,3,4,+,* will result in 14 (interpereted as 2*(3+4)).  
This is because the calculator uses a "stack" to keep track of calculations.  
Look at how the stack would be interpereted:

  *         \
  +   \      \
  4    } 7    } 14
  3   /      /
  2         /

### Using Stacks
We can now build a post-fixe calculator in java.
- Any bianary operation can be implemented
  - so `push("x")` would put a new number onto the stack.
  - to add, we would `push(pop() + pop())`, which would take the topmost 2 numbers and place their sum back on the stack.
- Uniary operations could be done as
  - i.e, we would just push(sin(pop())) to get the sin of the last number.
- Assume a zero when there are no more operands
- We can use scanners to read strings from the user, check
  - if it's a number, push it
  - if it's an operator, perform it
  - if there's nothing left in the stack, **catch** the NullPointerException, return a 0


#### Pseudocode
```
try{
If operator:
   if add:
   if subtract:
   ...
else:
   Convert to int
}catch exception(nullpointer)
   Print "not a number or operand"
```
