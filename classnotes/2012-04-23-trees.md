# Trees
*happy earth day.*


### Graph
A graph is a collection of nodes. The "edges" are the connectors between these nodes.

- Edges can have "weights" or values attached to them.
- They can be unidirectional or bidirectional.


### Trees
A tree is a special type of graph. It is a connected acyclic graph. (i.e., two parents can not have the same parent).  
A single node is designated as the **root**. This is general drawn on the top or left.

Alternate definition: A root node with 0 or more children, each child can have 0 or more children... ect. A parent has an edge to each child.

#### Examples

```
	Tree 1:	      	Tree 2:	        Tree 3:
           x               x 		   x
          / \		    \		  / \
	 x   x		     x		 x   x
        /|\    		      \ 	/ \ / \
       x x x    	       x        x x x x
```

#### Node Types
*External Nodes:* (aka leaf nodes) are on edges, have no children.
*Internal Nodes:* Have children, ways to get to the data.

#### Tree Types
- Quad
- Bianary  --> we're starting here.
- Splay
- Red/Black
- Van Emde Boas (Mr. K's Favorite)

#### Balanced Trees
- The concepts of a blaanced tree means the different sides are similar in size.
- Tree 3 above is a perfectly balanced tree. Tree 1 is not balanced.
- Tree 2 is NOT balanced. This is an odd case, but you can't have a "uniary" tree. Still, tree 2 is more balanced than tree 1, but less than tree 3.

#### Fullness/Completeness
- A tree is considered full if parents have chidren.
- Sparse trees have parents with no children. 
- Tree 1 is fairly sparse, tree 3 is full.
