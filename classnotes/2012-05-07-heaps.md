###Heaps


```

		90
	       /  \
	      75   87
	     / \   / \
	   60  55 80  81
 	  / \  / \  \  
	 32 59 50 1 40


```

#### Rules:
1. A child of any node has a value < that node
2. The tree is full top down, then left to right per row

#### Runtimes:

| Procedure			 | Runtime	 |
|--------------------------------|---------------|
| getMax			 | O(1)		 |
| remove [^fn-removexplain]	 | O(logn)	 |
| add [&fn-addexplain]	 	 | O(logn)	 |


[^fn-removexplain]: (1)Remove works by replacing element with the bottom right element, (2) then push down the value by swapping w/ the largest child.
[^fn-addexplain]: (1) Place item in at bottom right, then (2) push up the value until the parent is larger.


#### Heapsort:
Runtime: O(nlogn) [adding all elements, removing all elements]
1. Adds each number to a heap
2. removes each number from the heap
3. Because of how remove has to work, they will be sorted.
  
  
If...
Node index: i
Children index: 2i, 2i+1
Parent: i/2

### Constructing a Heap

Take our heap: *Indeces in brackets*
```

		  80[1]
	      	 /     \
             75[2]      42[3]
	    /    \      /    \
       60[4]    55[5] -1[6]  40[7]
      /    \      /
    32[8] 59[7]  50[10]

```

...And put it in an array: *BUT, keep the count of highest index in our index 0.
```
 0    1    2    3    4    5     6   7    8    9    10   11   12   13   14   15   16
{10,  80,  75,  42,  60,  55,  -1,  40,  32,  59,  50,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    }
```

Our heap is now easily stored.



Say we have the array: {8,-9,99,38,-18,89,-8,9,18,x,x}  
We know we will have 8 nodes total.
First, construct the heap with just -9. Now add 99, but note the issue. Our child is smaller than our parent, so they must swap. Continue until the tree is filled and ordered, following the above rules.  
This comes to order O(n).
