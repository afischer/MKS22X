### Hashes

Hashes are a way of encrypting data. It's why websites don't need to store your password, just your hash! If your password hashes into your hash, you're let in. But sometimes, certian algorithms have collissions. Thus, picking a password that hashes into the same hash as your real password would let you in as well (yet, that's highly unlikely).

#### Dealing with Collissions

So if we have colllisions, in a table, and we were to store them next to eachother, we would have to push all the following elements down in order to place it correctly. Thus we would create a runtime for method `add` of `O(n)` *(eww)*.
  
So let's do something more clever.  
Each of the indices in a list will point to a linked list.

```
    _
  0|_| -->bob>builder>null
  1|_| -->andrew>clone>dock>cat   [This was a colission, as both n(andrew) and n(dock) return 1]
  2|_| -->veronica>pan>null	  [Thus, it uses a linked lists]
  3|_| -->blah>booop>null
  4|_| -->key1>value1>null
  5|_| 
  6|_|  and so on... 
  7|_| 
  8|_| 
  9|_| 

```

This makes `add` a runtime of `O(1)`, and `access` as `O(m)` where M is the number of collisions. Much better.
  
#### Good Hash Functions

Take string 'hello'.
int(charAt(0)) * c1 + e*c2 + l*c3 + ...  
Where c1, c2... are unique prime constants
