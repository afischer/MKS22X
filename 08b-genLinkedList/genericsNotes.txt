in ordeer to take the class fo any generic, start off

public clsas Node<T>{

}

T is whatever tyep you are using.

so our nodes will be Node<T>

setData(string data) becomes -->>>> setData(T data)



private T data;

public void setNext(Node<T> next)

etc. We are changing to generics.

the only one we keep as a type other than T is public STRING to String(), which now returns data.toString();


or data + "" to trick it.... hehehe.
